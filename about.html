                    <p></p> Hi! My name is John Dave Pahamutang. You can call me Dave. I am 21 years old. My birthday is December 7, 2000. I live in Gulod, Novaliches. What drives me as a student Is my dreams. I want to pursue my dreams even though I am having a hard time through this online class because I am not a fast learner student. But then, I still choose to study because I know that someday all the struggles that I am facing right now will be worth it in the future.

                    <p></p> Jeffrey Ocenar was born on January 13 2001. He is a friendly young man who doesn't have much experience in life but lives morally upright. Jeffrey was a shy person but overtime he overcame his shyness and tried to come out of his comfort zone. With the help of the people around him, he overcame his fears and tried to look farther. With the help of his hobbies such as reading, playing basketball, and going out with his friends. He developed a sense of responsibility for his actions and how to socialize well. His motto is "Work smarter not harder" because he believes that by working smarter you can accurately do your job and find more meaning to it, other than working hard why not try to think of tactics that would be helpful not only for him but for the people around him.
